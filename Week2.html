<p>I did not get a proper graduation or ceremony but I made the most of it!</p>
<p>I was interested in different topics such as UX design, programming, graphic design and psychology.</p>
<p>The Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design at GBC seemed like a good fit for me, and I'm enjoying it so far!</p>
<p>Here is a virtual scrapbook of what I got up to during this summer!</p>
<br>


<h2>I did some baking!</h2>
<p>I baked gourmet minion cookies.</p>
